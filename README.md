## Necessary Libraries to run the function
These below libraries need to be installed in your python environment. So that we may import the necessary libraries to run the code.

    import numpy as np
    import math
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from scipy.stats import rankdata

## Running the code

- Just open the file (.py or .ipynb) and run the whole code.
- Then you will be prompt to give some inputs like you want to enter your data manually or have csv or excel file. 
- If manual then number of data for each variable.
- If csv or excel file then you have to enter the path of the file(for window users -->Right click on your file then click on copy as path ).
