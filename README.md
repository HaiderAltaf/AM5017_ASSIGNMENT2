#  Easy way to Find Correlation between two variables

I have build a function named  __find_correlation()__ to find the correlation between two variables in easiest way as per my exprience. Just run the code in python environment and you will be prompted to take necessary inputs to find correlation in your data

## Necessary Libraries to run the function
These below libraries need to be installed in your python environment. So that we may import the necessary libraries to run the code.

    import numpy as np
    import math
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from scipy.stats import rankdata
    
## Running the code

- Just open the file (.py or .ipynb) and run the whole code.
- Then you will be prompt to give some inputs like you want to enter your data manually or have csv or excel file. 
- If manual then number of data for each variable.
- If csv or excel file then you have to enter the path of the file(for window users -->Right click on your file then click on copy as path ) and paste in the prompted space.
- __If you want to run the code on google colab/kaggle, first upload your data on colab or kaggle environment and give the path from there and not the path from your local computer drive__
- and just follow some other instructions.
- Within seconds you will get your results.
- I have written the code in such a way that you will understand the concepts behind the finding correlation using different methods.
